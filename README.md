# SmartMart Data Analysis Report
## Python Analyst
### Overview
This part of the project focused on building and managing the SmartMart database using Jupyter. It involved setting up tables, ensuring data integrity, and performing in-depth analysis on sales, products, customers, and stock levels.
### Key Features
• Created a database schema with proper joins between tables and created a combined worksheet.
• Imported cleaned datasets (customers, products, stores, sales, stock levels).
• Removed duplicates and handled missing values using duplicated.sum() and dropna(), and converted into proper data types.
• Analyzed sales by product, customer, and store.
• Applied the Apriori Algorithm and Association Rule for data mining.
• Identified items, products, and categories for optimization.
• Found product pairs frequently bought together.
### Purpose
The Python analysis ensures clean, structured data and delivers actionable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and inventory needs, supporting both business strategy and Jupyter Python analyst reporting.
## Data Wrangling
### Overview
This part of the project focused on preparing and cleaning the raw datasets (customers, products, stores, sales, and stock levels) before loading them into the database and visualization tools.
### Key Features
• Removed duplicates and inconsistent entries across datasets.
• Handled missing values (e.g., unknown gender, empty city names).
• Standardized column names and formats for smooth integration.
• Ensured consistency of IDs (customer_id, product_id, store_id) across all datasets.
• Exported clean versions of all datasets for SQL and Power BI use.
• Organized cleaned files in a dedicated project folder.
### Purpose
Data wrangling ensures that all datasets are reliable, consistent, and analysis-ready. This step improves the accuracy of SQL queries, Python modeling, and Power BI dashboards, supporting high-quality business insights.
## SQL Analysis
### Overview
This part of the project focused on building and managing the SmartMart database in PostgreSQL. It involved setting up tables, ensuring data integrity, and performing in-depth analysis on sales, products, customers, and stock levels.
### Key Features
• Created database schema with proper primary and foreign keys.
• Imported cleaned datasets (customers, products, stores, sales, stock levels).
• Removed duplicates and handled missing values using SQL queries.
• Analyzed sales by product, customer, and store.
• Identified low-stock products for optimization.
• Found product pairs frequently bought together.
### Purpose
The SQL analysis ensures clean, structured data and delivers actionable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and inventory needs, supporting both business strategy and Power BI reporting.
